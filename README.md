# Inspiration
<p align="justify">I've always been fascinated by TED Talks and the immerse diversity of content that it provides for free.I was also thoroughly inspired by a TED Talk that visually explored TED Talks stats and I was motivated to do the same thing,albeit on a much less grander scale.Some of the questions that can be answered with this dataset:</p>

- How is each TED Talk related to every other TED Talk ?
- Which are the most viewed and most favorited Talks of all time ? Are they mostly the same ? What does this tell us ?
- What kind of topics attract the maximum discussion and debate (in the form of comments) ?
- Which months are most popular among TED and TEDx chapters ?
- Which themes are most popular amongst TEDsters ?
